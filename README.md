# :grapes: gatsby-starter-quiz
Create rich quizzes with Gatsby & Mdx. No need of database or headless CMS. Manage your data directly in your Mdx file's frontmatter and write your content in the body. Customize your HTML tags, use react components from a library or write your owns. Navigation will be automatically created between each question.

## Installation

### With [`gatsby-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli)

```bash
$ gatsby new my-quizzes https://github.com/raphadeluca/gatsby-starter-quiz
```

### With `git clone`

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:raphadeluca/gatsby-starter-quiz.git my-quizzes
$ cd my-quizzes
$ yarn
```

## Usage

### :one: Files
Edit your quizzes inside the `/quizzes` folder:
- Create a folder for each quiz
- Create a .mdx file for each question

### :two: Frontmatter
- Put your answers in the frontmatter. It's just an array of objects.
  - Each object is an answer with 2 keys:
    - Value: a string (the text that will be displayed)
    - Correct: a boolean (true, if correct)
- Give an index to your question to put them in a specific order (must be a string!)

```md
---
index: '1'
answers: [
    {
      value: 'Creative Style Sheets',
      correct: false,
    },
    {
      value: 'Cascading Style Sheets',
      correct: true,
    },
    {
      value: 'Crazy Style Sheets',
      correct: false,
    },
    {
      value: 'Custom Style Sheets',
      correct: false,
    },
  ]
---
```

### :three: Body
- Write your question and let your creativity take the power with MDX

Look at the examples in the quizzes folder to see how you can use React within a Markdown file (That's MDX!).
For a full explanation, read the [MDX docs](https://mdxjs.com/) and the [gatsby-MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-mdx/) implementation.

### :four: Link it from the home page

In the `/pages/index.js` file create a link to your quiz with the Card component. If your Mdx files are in the `/quizzes/css` folder, you can point to the first file of your quiz (let's say `01.mdx`) with `link="css-01"`.
```js
  <Card
    backgroundColor='#5bc0eb'
    title="CSS"
    description="Take a little quiz to test your CSS knowledges..."
    link="css-01"
  />
```

### :five: Deploy
- Create a repository on github with your project
- Deploy it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## :art: Configuration
You can change the feedback text or the footer colors in the appropriate files under the `/tokens` folder.
